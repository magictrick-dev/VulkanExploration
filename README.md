# Vulkan API Probe

The Vulkan API probe, step-by-step to see how the API works and functions.

Each stage is set in its own folder. Each one works independently of another and
builds separately. Each subsequent stage builds off another. The API will obviously
mature as you explore forward, but the main idea is to see the iterative process of
working with Vulkan as a reference starting point for building Vulkan applications.

### Requirements

You will need the Vulkan SDK, CMake, and an appropriate build environment that supports
C++20. Its pretty straight forward.

### License

See vendor/ for any distributed code licensing for any third-party libraries.
Otherwise, open source. Do what ever you want with this.
